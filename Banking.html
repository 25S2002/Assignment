        <h1>What Is Online Banking?</h1>
        <p>Online banking allows you to conduct financial 
            transactions through the Internet. 
            Online banking offers customers almost every service
            traditionally available through a local branch
            including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments.</p>
            <h2>How Online Banking Works</h2>
            <p> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-banks-5190371">Online banking </a>is a popular way of doing business with a bank.
             With online banking, you aren't required to visit a bank branch 
             to complete most of your basic banking transactions. 
             You can do all of this at your own convenience, 
             wherever you want—at home, at work, or on the go. 
             Online banking can be done using a browser or app. 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mobile-banking.asp">Mobile banking</a> is online banking that is done on a phone or tablet.</p>
             <h2>Bank anytime</h2>
             <p>With online banking, you don't need to visit a physical bank branch 
                but you can do it wherever you want—at home, work, or on the go. 
                In addition, you can typically do online banking 24/7. 
                However, customer support might not be available at all hours</p>
                <h2>Access accounts with browsers and apps</h2>
                <p>You can do online banking through a financial institution's web portal 
                using a web browser (such as Chrome or Safari) through a mobile app. 
                This allows you to access services from many locations.</p>
                <h2>Deposit Checks</h2>
                <p>You can usually deposit a check through a 
                mobile app using a process known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/remote-deposit-capture-definition-4684027">remote deposit capture</a>.
                 Enter the check amount,then use the app to take 
                 a photo of the front and back of the check to complete the deposit</p>
                 <h2>Manage Finances</h2>
                 <p>Many banks and credit unions offer tools to help you 
                    review and balance your budget built into apps or the website. 
                    You may also be able to track spending trends, or track savings toward a goal.</p>
                    <h2>Perform Other Financial Services</h2>
                    <p>Online banking transactions vary from one financial institution to another.
                     Most banks generally provide essential services such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ach-vs-wire-transfer-5208168">electronic transfers</a> 
                     and bill payments. Some banks even let you set up new checking or CD accounts 
                     or apply for credit cards through web portals. Other online functions include 
                     ordering checks, stopping payments on checks, or reporting a change of address</p>
                     <h2>Online Banks</h2>
                     <p>Online banks operate exclusively online, meaning they don't operate branches 
                        where you can conduct business in person. The best online banks offer low-cost
                         or free banking, plus above-average interest rates on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-4770633">savings accounts</a>, 
                       <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-cd-rates-4770214">certificates of deposit (CDs)</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-money-market-accounts-5096917">money market accounts</a></p>

                                 seven days a week. If your bank offers a payment network such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-zelle-7097991">Zelle</a>, 
                                 you can use your online bank account to send money to a person or business.

                                 <li><b>Fast and efficient:</b> Funds can be transferred between accounts almost instantly,
                                     especially if the two accounts are held at the same institution.
                                     Plus, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-make-mobile-check-deposits-7975275">mobile check deposits</a> can be made in just a few minutes.</li>
                                     <li><b>Ease of monitoring accounts:</b> You can closely monitor your accounts to spot suspicious activity.
                                         Around-the-clock access to banking information provides early fraud detection, 
                                         serving as a guardrail against financial losses.</li>

                        </p>
                        <h2>Cons explained:</h2>
                        <p><ol>
                            <li><b>Customer service challenges:</b>Sometimes, you might need to visit 
                                a branch to handle certain transactions, such as buying a cashier's check. 
                                In other cases, you might not even have access to a branch. Furthermore, 
                                you may prefer depositing checks, withdrawing money
                                or discussing your financial needs face-to-face.</li>
                                <li><b>Tech and connectivity required:</b> Some customers may need to be more comfortable with the 
                                    tech-heavy aspects of online banking. For example, they may need help with some online tasks, 
                                    such as setting up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automatic-bill-payment.asp">automatic payments</a>. In addition, online banking depends on a 
                                    reliable internet connection. Connectivity issues make it difficult to process 
                                    transactions when you want to.</li>
                                    <li><b>Hacking risk:</b>Although security continually improves, online accounts remain vulnerable. 
                                        Customers should use their wireless plans rather than public WiFi networks when
                                        logging into an online bank account. This can help prevent unauthorized account access</li>
                        </ol></p>
                        <h2>What Do You Need for Online Banking?</h2>
                        <p>To take advantage of online banking you'll need an internet connection and an electronic device 
                        like a computer or mobile phone. After setting up your account,
                        you'll keep handy a debit or other bank card, and access to your account numbers.
                        Setting up your online banking account can also be reasonably straightforward. 
                        But you'll need a few things to set up an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-open-a-checking-account-online-4797805">online checking account</a> or savings account, 
                        just like a brick-and-mortar bank account. The bank will spell out exactly what you need 
                        on its website, but it typically requires:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your name, date of birth, address, and other information</li>
                            <li>Social Security number</li>
                            <li>Government-issued ID with a photo, such as a driver's license or passport</li>
                            <li>A way to fund your account</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>How Can You Safely Use Online Banking?</h2>
                    <p>To shield your money and your personal information from cyber crooks, 
                    you should take these safety precautions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Set a strong, unique password, and change it regularly. The federal Cybersecurity & 
                        Infrastructure Security Agency recommends a password with at least 16 characters. 
                        The password should contain a random string of 
                        uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                        <li>Rely on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance-4427760">password manager</a>
                            to help discreetly set and remember passwords.</li>
                            <li>Enable <a target="blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twofactor-authentication-2fa.asp">two-factor authentication</a> 
                                or multi-factor authentication if it's available. 
                                This involves using at least two forms of identification, 
                                such as a password and a fingerprint, to access an online account.</li>
                                <li>Never provide your online banking details to other people.</li>
                                <li>Avoid online banking when using public WiFi, such as at a coffee shop or restaurant.</li>
                                <li>Check your accounts regularly for suspicious activity and report suspected fraud immediately.</li></ul>
                                </p>
                                <h2>Can You Use Online Banking to Pay Bills?</h2>
                                <p>You can use online banking to pay bills by logging into your online banking account to
                                     arrange bill payments electronically or by check. Online bill pay is a simple way 
                                     to take care of your bills and help ensure you're always <a target="blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/stop-paying-bills-late.asp">on time with payment</a>
                                    by setting up automatic payments. It works especially well for bills with regular,
                                    set amounts, such as a mortgage payment, insurance premium, or car payment.</p>     
                </ul></p>
